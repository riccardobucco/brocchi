# Data

You need to download two datasets:

- `train_catvnoncat.h5`
- `test_catvnoncat.h5`

Save both files in a `data` folder.

You can find them [here](https://github.com/JudasDie/deeplearning.ai/tree/8c484dd9deb9aa3d858bbd7405b42eef460cdf56/Improving%20Deep%20Neural%20Networks/Week1/Regularization/datasets).
